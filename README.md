# Music-Genre-Classification
Given a dataset containing different parameters of a song, we have trained and tested different Machine Learning models to classify the songs into 10 different genres

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis - Checking Correlation, Plotting Feature Importance
- Ran various ML models (Gradient Boost classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbours Classifier, SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGB Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Vanilla ANN, etc) and compared their results
- Chose MLP Classifier and used Manual Termination to obtain an accuracy of 92.39%
